## NON-INVERTING AMPLIFIER USING OP-AMP (μA741)
## Aim
To design and simulate a Non-Inverting Amplifier using μA741 in Proteus Design Suite and verify its voltage gain.
## Apparatus Required
•	μA741 Op-Amp
•	Resistor R1 = 10 kΩ
•	Resistor Rf = 100 kΩ
•	Signal Generator (1 kHz sine wave)
•	Dual Power Supply (±15V)
•	CRO / Oscilloscope
•	Connecting wires
## Circuit Diagram
(Draw neatly in record OR paste Proteus circuit screenshot)
Pin Configuration:
•	Pin 3 → Input (Non-inverting)
•	Pin 2 → Feedback network
•	Pin 6 → Output
•	Pin 7 → +15V
•	Pin 4 → −15V
## Theory
A Non-Inverting Amplifier is a closed-loop amplifier configuration in which the input is applied to the non-inverting terminal (+) of the op-amp.
The output signal is amplified and remains in phase with the input signal.
## Procedure
1.	Open Proteus software.
2.	Select μA741, resistors, signal generator, and CRO.
3.	Connect circuit in non-inverting configuration.
4.	Set R1 = 10kΩ and Rf = 100kΩ.
5.	Apply ±15V supply.
6.	Give input sine wave of 1V, 1kHz.
7.	Run simulation.
8.	Observe input and output waveforms.

## Result
The Non-Inverting Amplifier using μA741 Op-Amp was designed and simulated successfully.
The voltage gain obtained is approximately 11.
The output waveform is in phase with the input waveform.
## Conclusion
•	Gain depends on resistor ratio (Rf/R1).
•	Output is amplified without phase reversal.
•	Practical values are close to theoretical values.
